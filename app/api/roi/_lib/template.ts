  const context = `### 🧾 Understanding These Numbers

All values shown in this report represent **incremental profit** generated by your loyalty and reactivation program — *above and beyond your normal restaurant revenue.*  

They already include estimated program costs and reward redemptions, giving you a clear view of **net lift** driven solely by member engagement.  

These figures are powered by the **BookedTables™ loyalty platform** and are modeled on verified performance data across active restaurant operators.

  // ---------- Program Performance Insights ----------
  const analysis = `### 📊 Program Performance Insights

• Your Month-1 incremental gain of **$${combinedNetM1.toLocaleString()}** shows solid early engagement and redemption traction.  

  
• The projected 12-month cumulative profit of **$${cumulative.m12.toLocaleString()}** indicates that sustained participation could yield meaningful recurring ROI.  

  
• The balance between LoyaltyGP (**$${loyaltyGP.toLocaleString()}**) and CohortGP (**$${cohortGP.toLocaleString()}**) reflects healthy cross-mix between repeat and newly activated customers.  

  
• With retention rates typical of **BookedTables’** data network, this compounding model stays within the safe profit-to-discount ratio range — a sign of strong long-term sustainability.

Your ROI results demonstrate how ongoing engagement — not one-time ads — drives predictable, compounding growth.

They’ll help you optimize campaign timing, SMS engagement, and member segmentation to **sustain and amplify** these results month after month.
