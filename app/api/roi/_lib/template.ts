  const context = `### 🧾 Understanding These Numbers

All values shown in this report represent **incremental profit** generated by your loyalty and reactivation program — *above and beyond your normal restaurant revenue.*

They already include estimated program costs and reward redemptions, giving you a clear view of **net lift** driven solely by member engagement.

Figures are powered by the **BookedTables™ loyalty platform** and modeled on verified performance data across active restaurant operators.

  const analysis = `### 📊 Program Performance Insights

- **Month-1 incremental gain:** $${combinedNetM1.toLocaleString()} — strong early engagement and redemption traction.

- **12-month cumulative profit:** $${cumulative.m12.toLocaleString()} — indicates that sustained participation can yield substantial recurring ROI.

- **Balance between LoyaltyGP ($${loyaltyGP.toLocaleString()}) and CohortGP ($${cohortGP.toLocaleString()})** shows a healthy mix of repeat and newly activated customers.

- With retention rates typical of **BookedTables’ data network**, this compounding model stays within safe profit-to-discount ratios — a sign of strong long-term sustainability.

Your ROI results demonstrate how ongoing engagement — not one-time ads — drives predictable, compounding growth.

Unlike traditional marketing spend that stops when the ad stops, loyalty creates a **self-reinforcing growth cycle** where each visit strengthens the next.

To explore your potential return in detail, connect with a **BookedTables™ ROI Specialist** or review your loyalty dashboard analytics.

They can help you optimize campaign timing, SMS engagement, and member segmentation to **sustain and amplify** these results month after month.
