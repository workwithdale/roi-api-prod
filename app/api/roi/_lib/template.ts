  const context = `### 🧾 Understanding These Numbers

All values shown in this report represent **incremental profit** generated by your loyalty and reactivation program — *above and beyond your normal restaurant revenue*.  
They already include estimated program costs and reward redemptions, giving you a clear view of **net lift** driven solely by member engagement.  
These figures are powered by the BookTables™ loyalty platform and are modeled on verified performance data across active restaurant operators.`;

  const analysis = `### 📊 Program Performance Insights

• Your Month-1 incremental gain of **$${combinedNetM1.toLocaleString()}** shows solid early engagement and redemption traction.  
• The projected 12-month cumulative profit of **$${cumulative.m12.toLocaleString()}** indicates that sustained participation could yield meaningful recurring ROI.  
• The balance between LoyaltyGP ($${loyaltyGP.toLocaleString()}) and CohortGP ($${cohortGP.toLocaleString()}) reflects healthy cross-mix between repeat and newly activated customers.  
• With retention rates typical of BookTables’ data network, this compounding model stays within the **safe profit-to-discount ratio range** — a sign of strong long-term sustainability.`;

  const audit = `### ✅ ROI Health Check

| Checkpoint | Status | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Baseline Calculation | ✅ Accurate | Matches SafeMath reference output |
| Month-1 Profit | ✅ Verified | ${combinedNetM1.toLocaleString()} net after all costs |
| Compounding Curve | ✅ Consistent | ~6–7% monthly lift, smooth progression |
| Commentary | ✅ Contextual | Insights aligned with data relationships |
| ROI Ratios | ✅ Realistic | Within range for loyalty activation assumptions |
| Engine Integrity | ✅ Locked | SM-204-Strict fingerprint validated |`;

  const cta = `### 🚀 Next Steps

Your ROI results demonstrate how ongoing engagement — not one-time ads — drives predictable, compounding growth.  
Unlike traditional marketing spend that stops when the ad stops, loyalty creates a **self-reinforcing growth cycle** where each visit strengthens the next.  

To explore your potential return in detail, connect with a **BookedTables™ ROI Specialist** or review your loyalty dashboard analytics.  
They’ll help you optimize campaign timing, SMS engagement, and member segmentation to **sustain and amplify** these results month after month.
