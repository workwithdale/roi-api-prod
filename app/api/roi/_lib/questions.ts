Each plan includes a monthly SMS allowance for loyalty messages and reactivation campaigns.\n\nIf you don’t currently have a customer database, that’s perfectly fine — many restaurants don’t. That’s one of the biggest advantages of BookedTables: it builds your textable customer list automatically as guests scan your QR code and join your loyalty program.",

    why: "This measures how much more loyalty members spend compared to regular guests, reflecting higher check averages and order behavior.",
    prompt:
      "Loyalty guests tend to spend more — even when redeeming a discount. They often add appetizers, drinks, or desserts, and return more frequently. Industry data shows loyalty members spend **10–15% more per visit**, with some operators seeing lifts of 20% or higher once engagement deepens.",

    title: "Q6 — Estimate your expected loyalty participation rate",
    why: "This measures how many of your guests are — or will be — engaging with your loyalty program by joining, redeeming offers, or responding to messages. Even if you don’t have a program yet, this question helps estimate your potential participation rate once guests can join instantly through BookedTables.",
    prompt:
      "If you already have a loyalty program, think about what percentage of guests participate or return because of rewards or messages.\n\nIf you don’t have one yet, here’s what’s typical: **BookedTables users see about 9 in 10 guests (90%) opt in** when scanning a QR code for an instant 10% discount. Of those, **around 30–60% stay active** within a few months — a far higher engagement rate than old-fashioned punch cards or apps.\n\nTo model your ROI, select the level that best reflects your current or expected loyalty participation.",
    tip: "If you’re not running loyalty yet, choose 25–35%. That’s a realistic early estimate for restaurants using BookedTables QR signups.",
    optionsHeader: "How many of your guests do you think would engage with your loyalty program once offered?",
    options: [
      "1 — Around 10% (just starting or very new program)",

      "3 — Around 30% (early BookedTables average)",

    title: "Q7 — Estimate your average loyalty reward or discount value",
    why: "This measures how much you typically give back to loyal customers through rewards, discounts, or comped items. Think of it as a smart reinvestment in repeat business — a loyalty budget that earns measurable returns, not a cost that disappears after one ad run.",
    prompt:
      "Traditional marketing — like print coupons, paid ads, or delivery app promos — often produces only a short-term bump in traffic. Once the promotion ends, the results fade and the cost repeats.\n\nBookedTables takes the opposite approach: it creates **ongoing customer return cycles** that compound over time. Because each offer targets guests who already know and like your restaurant, every reward builds long-term loyalty instead of one-shot advertising spikes.\n\nMost restaurants find that offering **10–20% loyalty value** keeps customers returning while protecting margins. High-growth operators may offer more for short bursts, but the best results come from balance and consistency.",
    tip: "If you’re not sure, start with 10–15%. That’s the most common and sustainable range for BookedTables loyalty users.",
    optionsHeader: "On average, what value or discount do you plan to offer to loyal customers when they redeem a reward?",

      "3 — Around 15% (balanced baseline, healthy ROI)",
      "4 — About 20% (growth-focused promotion level)",
      "5 — Around 25% (aggressive incentive, short-term lift)",
      "6 — About 30% (very aggressive offer, limited-time campaigns)",
      "7 — 35% or higher (rare — unsustainable long-term for most restaurants)"
