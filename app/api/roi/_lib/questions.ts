    why: "This measures how many of your guests are â€” or will be â€” engaging with your loyalty program by joining, redeeming offers, or responding to messages. Even if you donâ€™t have a program yet, this question helps estimate your potential participation rate once guests can join instantly through BookedTables.",
    prompt: `If you already have a loyalty program, think about what percentage of guests participate or return because of rewards or messages.

If you donâ€™t have one yet, hereâ€™s whatâ€™s typical: **BookedTables users see about 9 in 10 guests (90%) opt in** when scanning a QR code for an instant 10% discount. Of those, **around 30â€“60% stay active** within a few months â€” a far higher engagement rate than old-fashioned punch cards or apps.

ðŸ’¬ *Reminder: Reply with the **option number** that best matches your estimated participation rate once loyalty is active.*`,

    title: "Q7 â€” Estimate your average loyalty reward or discount value",
    why: "This measures how much you typically give back to loyal customers through rewards, discounts, or comped items. Think of it as a smart reinvestment in repeat business â€” a loyalty budget that earns measurable returns, not a cost that disappears after one ad run.",
    prompt: `Traditional marketing â€” like print coupons, paid ads, or delivery app promos â€” often produces only a short-term bump in traffic. Once the promotion ends, the results fade and the cost repeats.

BookedTables takes the opposite approach: it creates **ongoing customer return cycles** that compound over time. Because each offer targets guests who already know and like your restaurant, every reward builds long-term loyalty instead of one-shot advertising spikes.

ðŸ’¬ *Reminder: Reply with the **option number** (not the %). Example: enter \`3\` for "Around 15% â€” balanced baseline, healthy ROI."*`,
    tip: "If youâ€™re not sure, start with 10â€“15%. Thatâ€™s the most common and sustainable range for BookedTables loyalty users.",
